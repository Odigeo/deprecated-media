The Media service is a RESTful API service, speaking JSON.

It's used to manage static media files such as web site images, mp3s, swf files, etc.
 
The service manages a Riak node cluster via an internal gem load balancer.
Between the Riak cluster and the web is a caching proxy (Varnish). This yields
a high-capacity delivery solution with modest backend means.
